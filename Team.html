			<h3>Jade Sessions, Jacqueline Wen, Nana Appea, and Maria Javier</h3>
			
			<h4> Jade Sessions</h4>
			<center><div class="Jadeimage">
			</div></center>
			<p>Jade is a 16 year old rising senior at Uniondale High School.
			"I never thought I would enjoy computer science so much.
			It never seemed tangible to me but now I know it can take me anywhere I could possibly dream of.
			I plan on studying computer science and using it to further combine my passions.
			She hopes to pursue computer science in college and use it to further combine her passions.</p>
			
			
			<h4> Jacqueline Wen</h4>
			<center><div class="Jackieimage">
			</div></center>
			<p>Jacqueline Wen, age 17, is a rising senior attending John P. Stevens High School in New Jersey.
			"I was honestly never aware of the gender gap in technology as it was never evident in my school's computer science courses ,
			however, as I read more about the statistics and talked about the issue with my friends already in the field,
			I was surprised by the general consensus that there were hardly any females in tech."
			</p>
			
			<h4>Nana Appea</h4>
			<center><div class="Nanaimage">
			</div></center>
			<p>Nana Appea is a 17 year old girl who attends Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn, NY.
			"I never really knew what Computer Science was until I was well within the Girls Who Code summer immersion program.
			I thought to myself "Oh cool" I might be able to make video games and other cool stuff,
			but now I know there is so much more to Computer Science than that,
			and it can be meaningful and really make a huge difference in the world by helping people.
			I plan to explore more subjects in Computer Science in the future."</p>
			
			<h4>Maria Javier</h4>
			<center><div class="Mariaimage">
			</div></center>
			<p>As a rising senior at Notre Dame School, Maria joined Girls Who Code because she wanted to learn more about computer science
			and be surrounded by an encouraging environment full of other girls that share the same passion.
			" I always loved science ever since I visited the Museum of Natural history.
			Introduced to computer science at Girls Who Code, I know that I can use computer science with engineering and integrate it to help others in their everyday lives.
			I know that I am equipped with a powerful tool that can change the future. "</p>
